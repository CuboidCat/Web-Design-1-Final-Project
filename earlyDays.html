    <h1>Everything has to start somewhere</h1>
    <p>Programming has a long and storied history, with many people contributing to its development over the years.
        The history of programming can be traced back to the early days of computing, when the first programmable computers were developed.
        These early computers were large, expensive, and complex machines that required a great deal of technical expertise to operate.
        However, they laid the foundation for the modern computer systems that we use today.
        In this section, we will explore the early days of programming and the key figures who helped to shape the field.</p>

    <div class="Babbage">
        <h1>Charles Babbage</h1>
        <p>Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who is best known for originating the concept of a programmable computer.
            Considered the "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs.
            Babbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers ever built, and they laid the foundation for the modern computer systems that we use today.
            Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine laid the foundation for the development of modern computers, and he is considered one of the pioneers of computer science.</p>

    <div class="Turing">
        <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
        <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist.
            He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
            Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
            providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
            which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.

    <div class="Atanasoff">
        <h1>John Atanasoff</h1>
        <p>John Atanasoff was an American physicist and inventor who is best known for inventing the first electronic digital computer.
            Atanasoff's computer, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, was the first electronic digital computer ever built.
            The computer was designed to solve systems of linear algebraic equations and was the first to use binary digits to represent numbers.
            Atanasoff's work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers, and he is considered one of the pioneers of computer science.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Roberts">
        <h1>Henry Roberts</h1>
        <p>Henry Roberts was an American engineer and inventor who is best known for his work on the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer.
            Roberts was one of the key figures in the development of the ENIAC, which was designed to solve complex mathematical problems.
            The ENIAC was the first computer to use electronic components and was the first to be programmable.
            Roberts' work on the ENIAC laid the foundation for the development of modern computers, and he is considered one of the pioneers of computer science.</p>
